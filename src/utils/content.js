        content1: `Kagumo High School is a boy's national secondary school located between Kirichu and Kiganjo townships at Kagumo near Karatina on the Nyeri-Nairobi road in Kenya.`,
        content2: `It was one of the first schools in Kenya to allow native black Africans to sit for university level entrance exams, doing so in 1946. It is one of the best high schools in Kenya, with prominent old boys in Kenya and globally.[1] It has several notable alumni including lawyers, doctors and politicians such as the constitutional lawyer Gibson Kamau Kuria .In academics, sports and creative arts this school has a long-standing rivalry with Nyeri High School, with meetings between the two schools, particularly in rugby, and basketball the most intense.`,
        content3: `In 1942, Miss Stott succeeded Miss Kerby. By this time, because of the existing overcrowding and lack of modern facilities, there was considerable demand for a new school. By 1944, the present site of about 100 acres on Kileleshwa Hill had been approved and sterling pound 150 had been voted in the 1945 budget as a token sum towards the laying out of the grounds. Eventually, the total cost of building and laying out of the grounds reached sterling pounds 700,000.
        The present school began to take shape and in 1950, 100 boarders moved into two boarding blocks of the partially completed new school. The site at that time looked very different from today. The trees and flowering shrubs, which do so much enhance and beautify the grounds, remained to be planted; the chapel, the library, and the swimming pool were yet to be built.  
        Apart from these individuals, the government gave all the monies for capital development. In the early 1980s, cost-sharing between the parents and the government was effected. The present Parents Teachers Association was started on 12th July 1979. The idea was proposed by Professor J.M. Mungai who became the first chairman. The following people acted as the caretakers in the executive committee until the Annual General Meeting was held. Professor Joseph M. Mungai, Ven. John Kago, Professor F. A. Mutere, Professor V. K. Gupta, Mrs. M. Mpaayei, Mr. B.O.  Okudo, Mrs. Grace Ogot, Mr. C. A. De Ameida, Mr. Davidson Ngini, and M. L. Handa, Deputy Registrar General.
        The P.T.A. was registered with the Attorney General in October 1979 and Professor Joseph Mungai became the first P.T.A. chairman until 1985 when Mr Wasunna took over up to February 1995. Thereafter, the chairpersons of the P.T.A. were: Prof. K.  Wambari (1995-1997), Mr. P. E. Mwaisaka (1997-1998), Justice Lee Muthoga (1998-1999), Major (Rtd) C.N. Diffu (2007 -2009), Prof. J. Kaimenyi (2008 – 2009), Mr. G. S. Mutungi (2009-2013), Dr. Bitange Ndemo (2013-2015), Mrs. Gacicio( 2015-2016), Rev Robin Mulunda 2016-2017 the  P.A. chairman is Mr. Lilan who took over in 2017 to date.  
        It is worthwhile noting that the school enrolment has gradually increased over time; in the late 30s the school had 35 students, in the 40s, 150 and this rose to 500 in the 50s.  This upward trend continued in the 60s with a total of students’ body of 650. In the 70s the total population had risen to 700. The 80s and 90s had an enrollment of between 800 to 850.  Currently, the school population stands at 1285 students.`

        content1: `The very first Schools Drama Festival in Kenya was held in April 1959 at Princess of Gloucester School (the present Pangani Girls' School, Nairobi). At the time, only European and Asian schools participated. Opiyo Mumma notes that it was strictly modelled on a typical British drama festival for higher education, and its social base lay with expatriate teachers, inspectors and staff of the British Council, and the participating students. In 1971, the play Olkirkenyi, written by Irish-language poet & author Brian Ó Maoileoin, together with his students at Olkejuado Secondary School (in the Rift Valley Province) where he taught for three years, became the first indigenous play to win the National Drama Festival at the Kenya National Theatre (KNT). The play, a love story set in the bush, written in Kiswahili and performed by the students of Olkejuado Secondary School, is the first evidence of Kenyan children participating in the festival. Brian Ó Maoileoin thought it was absurd that there never had been a play in one of the native languages of the people performed in the Drama Festival. His vision with Olkirkenyi was to give the stage to the Kenyan youth and to their languages and culture. The play marks the beginning of Kenyan youth using the play format and incorporating their own indigenous language, to articulate social issues that directly affected their lives.

        content2: `The Kenya Schools and Colleges Drama Festival is a series of student theatre competitions in Kenya, held from January to April each year, advancing through local, county and regional stages to the National Drama Festival. Students from primary schools to colleges take part, with total annual participation of roughly five million students, making it the biggest educational theatre event in Africa.
        The first Schools Drama Festival was held in 1959, and had its roots in British colonialism, modelled on a typical British drama festival for higher education. An indigenous play first won in 1971. Through the 1970s, the festival became a hotbed of radical theatre, and an outlet of protest against the Kenya African National Union (KANU) regime's suppression of theatre. Kenya's first College Drama Festival took place in 1975, and a Primary Schools Drama Festival in 1981. In the early 1980s, the primary, secondary and colleges festivals were integrated into a single event.
        In addition to traditional stage plays, the festival has been expanded to include other modes of drama. Dramatised verse and cultural creative dance were added in 1981, African storytelling narratives in 1997, and between 2012 and 2016 the festival was expanded to include stand-up comedy, modern dance, mime and film.`,
        content3: `2020 Drama and film festivals calendar begins with the National Adjudicators briefing, which is scheduled for December.
        National Adjudicators Briefing will run from 23rd to 27th of December 2019. The venue is the Kenya School of Government (KSG) in Kabarnet, Baringo County.
        Then the Festivals will begin in late February at the Sub County Levels. The Sub-County festivals are expected to be done by the 24th of February 2020.
        County Drama and Film Festivals are also scheduled to end by the 9th of March 2020 to give room for the Regionals.
        By the 21st of March, 2020, the Regional Festivals should be a closed chapter.`,

        content1: `Rugby has a long history in Kenya.
        The first recorded game in Kenya took place in 1909, when a team composed of predominantly British "Officials" took on mainly Afrikaaner "Settlers" in Mombasa.[4]
        The Rugby Football Union of Kenya (RFU-K) was formed in 1923, the same year when Nairobi District team split to form Harlequins RFC (which is not the current club Kenya Harlequins which was formed in 1952) and Nondescripts RFC. Impala RFC, another traditional club was founded in the 1930s. For a number of years, the Nondescripts and the Harlequins were two of the best sides in the country and dominated Kenyan rugby.[4]
        When the British Isles went to South Africa for their 1955 tour and their 1962 tour, they played East Africa sides in Nairobi, on the return leg of their journey. The Lions won both of these games, 39-12 [5] and 50-0 [6] respectively.
        The East Africa team played some of the best sides in the world, including the British Lions in 1955, South Africa in 1961, and Wales in 1964.`,
        content2: `
        Kagumo High School on Saturday beat Laiser Hill 18-14 to be crowned this year’s Brookside National Secondary School Term One 15s rugby champions at Nairobi School. It was Kakamega’s first title since 2013, and their seventh overall. The Barbarians touched down twice, one conversion and two penalties against Laiser Hill’s two converted tries. In the play-off, Upper Hill secured third spot after a 12-3 win over 2004 champions St Mary’s Yala. Kakamega’s success saw them avenge their 10-8 loss to Laiser earlier in the competition and the win delighted the team’s coach Amos Wamanga.
        “It was a very difficult final. We had a good start, managing to keep them at bay and then used our wingers well. They came back stronger in the second half but we managed to soak in the pressure. It feels good to be champions once again,” Wamanga told Nation Sport. Kakamega, who are also the East African champions, led 15-7 at half time, having raced to a 15-0 lead at one point.
        They endured some serious pressure in the second half as the Kevin Wambua-coached Laiser Hill hit back to trail by a point at 15-14, before centre back Derrick Ashiundu drove in a penalty to put the game to bed. Ashiundu gave his side the lead in the sixth minute through a pin-point penalty conversion making it 3-0 as both sides struggled to settle in the match.
        NUMERICAL ADVANTAGE
        Laiser Hill's open side flanker Christopher Asira was sin-binned on 15 minutes and Kakamega made use of the numerical advantage to extend their lead to 15-0. Fourth five seconds after Asira’s ejection, tight head Charkes Omulako powered through the Laiser defence before Asiundu converted. Minutes later Kevin Imani made use of his physical strength to cross the try line. Asira returned and Laiser would mount a comeback into the match as John Bruce escaped tackles to barge over after a quickly taken penalty with Johnstone Olindi converting. Laiser pinned back Kakamega in the second half as they went in search of more points to level the match. Skipper Joel Inzuga escaped two Kakamega defenders before squeezing in the try and Olindi converted once again.
        The momentum swung to Laiser Hill and they continued to press for the winning try but it was Kakamega who had the last laugh as Ashiundu kicked the penalty and his side held on for the narrow win.
